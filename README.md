# Columbia IEOR Machine Learning Reading Group

This site hosts the schedule, the reading list, and the blog posts from ML-IEOR. Check out the [`_drafts`](/drafts/) folder for examples of blog posts. When writing a new blog post, first create a Markdown file in the `_drafts` folder and use Github's preview to see what it will look like (unfortunately, Github won't render latex, but the site will).
