# Columbia Advanced Machine Learning Seminar

This site hosts the schedule, the reading list, and the blog posts from CAMLS. Check out the [`_drafts`](/drafts/) folder for examples of blog posts. When writing a new blog post, first create a Markdown file in the `_drafts` folder and use Github's preview to see what it will look like (unfortunately, Github won't render latex, but the site will). When you're done, contact the admin (Scott Linderman) for a final check before moving your post to the `_posts` folder.
