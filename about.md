The Columbia Advanced Machine Learning Seminar is a reading group that meets weekly on Thursdays, 2-4pm, in Stat 1025.  The purpose of this group is different than others that many of us attend; it will be focused on current, advanced papers in machine learning research, and it will be fast-paced.  A list of papers can be found [here]({{site.base_url}}/papers). 

Logistically, there will be 1-2 presenters and a scribe, to record our discussion in blog-style format on this website.  All attendees will be added to the presentation and scribe schedule.

Organized by Scott Linderman, Liam Paninski, and John Cunningham.
