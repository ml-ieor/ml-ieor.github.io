The Columbia IEOR Machine Learning Reading Group is a reading group that meets weekly on Thursdays, 5-6:30pm, in Mudd 317.  The purpose of this group is different than others that many of us attend; it will be focused on current, advanced papers in machine learning research, and it will be fast-paced.  A list of papers can be found [here]({{site.base_url}}/papers). 

Logistically, there will be a presenter who leads a discussion and a scribe, to record our discussion in blog-style format on this website.  All attendees will be added to the presentation and scribe schedule.

Organized by Francois Fagan, Garud Iyengar, and Martin Haugh.
